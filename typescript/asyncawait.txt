API
promise(api).then(logic1(api2)).catch(logic2(api3))
chaining is very difficult if logic invokes apis and thier logic also apis recursivesly
this is like multiple infite if else in ternary

this is like recursive function calls with if else blocks
so we have async and await in ES6

async function example()
{
    const response=await fetch(api);
     if(response.ok)
     {const second=await fetch(logic1(api2));}
     else
     {const second=await fetch(logic2(api3));}
}
